This library for Arduino is intended to provide functions for connecting to and controlling ATEM video switchers from Blackmagic Design. They make awesome switchers, really cheap ones too and they are controlled over IP! So while you can get away with using their nice Win/Mac app and switch video professionally, you can also shell out a lot of money on a hardware interface which the broadcast pros will prefere any day. Hey, it's a win for everyone!

Now, with this class, you can develop your own custom hardware designs to switch video! For instance, what about having a foot pedal to make a cut, eh?
